The abstract is pasted below:

The behavior of ion channels and transporters is often modeled using discrete state continuous-time Markov models. Such models are helpful for the interpretation of experimental data and can guide the design of experiments by testing specific predictions. Here, we describe a computational tool that allows us to create Markov models of chosen complexity and to calculate the predictions on a macroscopic scale, as well on a single-molecule scale. The program calculates steady-state properties (current, state probabilities, and cycle frequencies), deterministic macroscopic and stochastic time courses, gating currents, dwell-time histograms, and power spectra of channels and transporters. In addition, a visual simulation mode allows us to follow the time-dependent stochastic behavior of a single channel or transporter. After a basic introduction into the concept of Markov models, real-life examples are discussed, including a model of a simple K+ channel, a voltage-gated sodium channel, a 3-state ligand-gated channel, and an electrogenic uniporter. In this manner, the article has a modular architecture, progressing from basic to more advanced topics. This illustrates how the MarkovEditor program can serve students to explore Markov models at a basic level but is also suited for research scientists to test and develop models on the mechanisms of protein function.
